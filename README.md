# DevJoe-Bot
This is DevJoe's discord bot

# Some notes
This discord bot always runs in the background. To shut it down, you must use ;shutdown.

# Setup
To set up for the first run, you'll need to generate a config. To do this, open your command line, and run the file with one argument: `GEN`

It will ask you some questions, then after, it will close. After this, you can run it normally, or if you want to see logging, run it from the command line.
